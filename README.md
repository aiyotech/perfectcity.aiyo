PerfectCity.aiyo will help you decide the best place to live. This project was created for [ChallengePost Open Data Summer Jam 2015](http://challengepost.com/software/perfectcity-io). The [about page](http://aiyotech.github.io/perfectcity.aiyo/about.html) has more information on how the algorithm works and [this iPython notebook](https://github.com/aiyotech/perfectcity.aiyo/blob/master/data_curation.ipynb) has details of the curation process.

## Problem Statement

Each of us have our personal and unique lifestyles. A city must complement that lifestyle to ensure that you feel happy and energetic every day. Too often we find ourselves in cities that do not suit us. 

## Objectives

- [x] Learn from data to classify cities based on criteria: Average Age, Restaurants, Parks and Recreation, Events, Educational Institutes, Jobs etc.
- [x] Front end service to allow user to rank what they find important in their lifestyle and we make city recomendations based on this.

## Technologies

- Recommendation algorithm based on inverse weighted eucledian distance
